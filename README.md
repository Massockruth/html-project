Project scenario
Imagine you're a recently graduated information technology student with some related work experience. 
You want to showcase your skills and qualifications to potential employers and decide to create your own website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
You will determine the content to feature, how to present it, and user interactivity. Building your website will enable potential employers 
to see your work and provide a more concrete understanding of your skills and abilities.
